## How do I approach designing software?
I generally approach designing software from a data-centric perspective. I like to begin with what needs to be worked with and then design around the required actions to implement that functionality. As for UI design, I 
usually just try to mimic some other project that I can find.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
For this project, I did little in the way of design. For the graphics layouts, I basically used trial and error with a small amount of math to position things.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
There was very little that I did in the are of design beyond following the rubric and the instructor’s advice.

## How do I approach developing programs?
For projects such as this, I like to first examine the entire codebase to get a good footing on what it does. Then I look into the requirements for the project and see where changes and additions need to be made.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I did not develop any new strategies for this project.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was at the dead center for this project. Positioning the object in particular required a large amount of trial and error.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I have been coding for about 40 years. My approach did not really change or evolve for this project.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to become a Malware Researcher / Analyst. CS is the central core of this type of activity.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I found the class interesting, but I don’t really think that it will help much in my future endeavors.
